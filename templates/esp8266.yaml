    #
    # One next to the WiFi antenna belongs to ESP-12 chip and is bound to UART,
    # so it blinks on flash.
    #
    # Another from NodeMCU itself is located near micro USB interface on the RST
    # button side. That one is bound to WAKE pin, which is the one to connect to
    # RESET pin if the board is expected to wake from deep sleep on timer.
    #
    # We will use the NodeMCU LED since we rarely need deep sleep.
