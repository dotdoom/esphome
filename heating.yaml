  # The entire setup consists of:
  #
  # - Furnace that burns oil and produces heat.
  #   It only burns when necessary, i.e. some of the
  #   controlled temperatures are below set values.
  #
  #   r/o: active (burning) / inactive (idle).
  #
  # - Boiler which keeps hot water (but can also heat it
  #   electrically, albeit turned on/off at the mains).
  #
  #   r/o: temperature.
  #
  # - Floor heating which is technically controlled
  #   via furnace control panel, but is a separate system.
  #   It also includes two radiators (which are normally off),
  #   but due to ambiguity of "heating" meaning both the process
  #   and a house-warming system, we opt in for this specific
  #   "floor heating" term.
  #
  #   r/o: flow temperature.
  #   r/o: active (flow temperature controlled) / inactive (idle).
  #   r/w: mode (instruct the flow to start heating).
